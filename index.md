## Who am I?

Hi, I am Junchuan Fan, a GIScience and computational social science researcher interested in human activity and movement, and human place interactions.  
My current research mostly focus on using big spatiotemporal data analytics to **uncover human activity and mobility pattern in space, analyze semantic characteristics of places infused by human activities therein, and model the dynamic interactions between human and places**. 

Check out my [home page](https://smart-spatial.com/).  

## What I do?
Currently, I am a Research Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
I work on developing effective geocomputing solutions to  integrate and analyze massive spatial-temporal-social data (e.g., GPS trajectory, cellphone records, social media data) for transportation-related applications.  
Most of data crunching I do are carried out using python, R and scala.  

Sometimes, I also work as a volunteer data scientist for [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/).
